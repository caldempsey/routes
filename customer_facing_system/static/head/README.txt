The head files are a strategy used to assist integration. Each team member used PHP head files to link the necessary resources (so we would not have duplicate libraries i.e. of bootstrap).

To install use PHP to add these resources to the web-page head i.e.

<?php include 'static/head/[desired head].html'; ?>
